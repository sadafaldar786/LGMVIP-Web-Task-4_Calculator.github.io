This is repository for LGMVIP Task-4 for creating Calculator using HTML, CSS and Javascript

Project Description - 
During my internship, I took up the challenge to create a simple yet sleek Neumorphic Calculator using the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! The concept of Neumorphism, with its modern blend of skeuomorphism and flat design, provided the perfect opportunity to develop an intuitive user interface.

Features:

ðŸŒŸ Basic Arithmetic Functions: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

ðŸŒŸ Neumorphic Design: A visually appealing and interactive calculator interface

ðŸŒŸ User-Friendly: Easy-to-use and responsive design for a smooth user experience

ðŸŒŸ Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling to avoid calculation issues
